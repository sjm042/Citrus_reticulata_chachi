##Data for Figure 5.

Firstly, the .nwk file was generated by MEGA-X,  an integrated tool for conducting automatic and manual sequence alignment, inferring phylogenetic trees.
Secondly, the .nwk file was imported to ITOL (website:https://itol.embl.de/). 
Thirdly, drop the .txt files into the tree which ITOL generated.
